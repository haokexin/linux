	  Layer Two Tunneling Protocol

	  From RFC 2661 <http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2661.txt>.

	  L2TP facilitates the tunneling of packets across an
	  intervening network in a way that is as transparent as
	  possible to both end-users and applications.

	  L2TP is often used to tunnel PPP traffic over IP
	  tunnels. One IP tunnel may carry thousands of individual PPP
	  connections. L2TP is also used as a VPN protocol, popular
	  with home workers to connect to their offices.

	  The kernel component handles only L2TP data packets: a
	  userland daemon handles L2TP the control protocol (tunnel
	  and session setup). One such daemon is OpenL2TP
	  (http://openl2tp.org/).

	  If you don't need L2TP, say N. To compile all L2TP code as
	  modules, choose M here.
