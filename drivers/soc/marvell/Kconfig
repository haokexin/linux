config OCTEONTX2_SDP_PF
	tristate "OcteonTX2 SDP PF driver"
	depends on ARM64 && PCI && OCTEONTX2_AF && OCTEONTX2_MBOX
	default y
	help
	  This driver configures the SDP RVU PF when OcteonTx is in PCIe EndPoint
	  mode. It sets up the SDP rings  and the VFs to be used in packet transfer
	  using the NIX block.

	  To compile this as a module choose M here.

config OCTEONTX2_DPI_PF
	tristate "OcteonTX2 DPI-DMA PF driver"
	depends on ARM64 && PCI
	default m
	help
	  Select this option to enable DPI PF driver support.
	  DPI (DMA packet interface) provides DMA support for MAC.
	  This driver intializes DPI PF device and enables VFs for supporting
	  different types of DMA transfers.

config GTI_WATCHDOG
	tristate "GTI Watchdog driver"
	depends on ARM64
	help
	  GTI Watchdog driver, provides ioctl's for applications to
	  setup and enable the NMI Watchdog and also provides
	  an mmap() interface to map GTI device memory into process
	  address space for the application to directly poke the
	  GTI watchdog without any kernel support and entry.

config HW_CSR_ACCESS
	tristate "Access HW Device Config Space"
	depends on OCTEONTX2_AF
	default m
	help
 	  provides an interface which enables user space utility to read from or to write
	  to HW Device Config Space Registers, Contexts, Memory.

config OCTEONTX_SERDES
	tristate "OcteonTX2 serdes debug commands"
	default m
	depends on ARM64 && HAVE_ARM_SMCCC && DEBUG_FS
	help
	  Provides debugfs commands which allows to collect serdes information,
	  capture eye, use PRBS, configure serdes in loopback mode, and
	  read/write TX tuning parameters.

config MARVELL_FWLOG
	tristate "firmware log interface"
	depends on ARM64
	help
	  Provides interface to read firmware boot logs. Firmware bootlogs are saved
	  in memory that is accessible from kernel. Enabling this option allows the
	  user to dump the firmware boot logs.

	  Firmware needs to build with `RECORD_FWLOG=1` to see the boot logs and
	  U-boot config `CONFIG_FWLOG_TTYMEM` is also required to have this feature
	  validated from linux.

	  Say Y here if you want to dump the firmware boot logs from linux shell. This
	  option is available only for Octeon10 and OcteonTX2 platforms.

config MVMDIO_UIO
	tristate "Marvell MDIO interface driver"
	  default m
	select MDIO_THUNDER
	help
	  Select this option if you want to provide an interface for userspace
	  PHY drivers to access Marvell's MDIO bus.

config MARVELL_CN10K_SERDES_DIAGNOSTICS
	tristate "Marvell SerDes diagnostics debugfs driver"
	default m
	depends on DEBUG_FS
	help
	  Select this option if you want to enable SerDes diagnostics
	  interface for performing PRBS, setting Loopback mode or
	  reading/writing Tx/Rx tuning parameters.

config MRVL_PHY_DIAGNOSTICS
	tristate "Marvell PHY diagnostics debugfs driver"
	default m
	depends on DEBUG_FS
	help
	  Select this option if you want an additional interface for
	  extended diagnostics functions for the PHY. This complements
	  functionality offered by ethtool. Requires PHY driver support in ATF.

config OCTEONTX_INFO
       tristate "OcteonTX Info driver"
	depends on PROC_FS
	help
	provides procfs interface to board information like board name, board revision
	mac addresses, board serial number and more. These are boards housing Marvell
	OcteonTX family chipsets.

config MRVL_SWUP
        tristate "Marvell firmware secure update"
        depends on ARM64
        help
          Provide debugfs interface for firmware update.
          Supported on cnXX family.
          Currently supported operations:
            -> TIM Version check
            -> TIM Hash verification
            -> TIM firmware update

config MARVELL_PTM_EP
	tristate "Marvell PCIe PTM EP"
	default m
	help
	  Provides PTM requestor(EP) support. The driver provides interface for
	  triggering and capturing time.

	  To compile this as a module, choose M here. The module will be called
	  mrvl-ptm-ep.
