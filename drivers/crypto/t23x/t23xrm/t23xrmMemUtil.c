/**
 * All functions here in t23xrmMemUtil.c are designed to handle the
 * mapping, lockdown, and construction of fragment lists as required for
 * (a) a single memory buffer specified in a descriptor, and (b)
 * the host operating system in question.
 *
 * There are six calls present, handling the mapping translation and
 * unmapping/freeing of buffers consisting of three different classes
 * of memory as:
 *
 *   (1) Logical addresses
 *   (2) Virtual addresses in a user-process address space
 *   (3) Virtual addresses in the kernel's address space
 *       (unimplemented in this release)
 *
 * Of course, hardware crypto accelerators generally cannot do address
 * translations on their own; this translation to physical addresses
 * must be done for them. Advanced crypto accelerators do generally
 * have the capability to act on a buffers fragmented into varying
 * locations (as buffers in virtual address space may be), so one of
 * the actions that must take place here is the construction of a
 * scatter-gather list for that buffer.
 *
 * Therefore, these functions are all passed:
 * (1) an entity ID for the pointer value in the descriptor, normally
 * the ordinal value of where the pointer element occurs in the
 * descriptor's construction,
 * (2) the descriptor in question (this is core dependent), and
 * (3) a pointer to auxiliary mapping information that the IF will
 * preserve with the descriptor; this holds enough information to "free"
 * any descriptive resources later. These functions will work upon the
 * three classes of memory in this way:
 *
 *   - "Translate" functions will:
 *     + translate a buffer address to physical
 *     + if virtual,
 *       > make sure pages comprising the buffer are swapped in
 *       > lock down those pages
 *       > allocate a scatter-gather list adequate for this buffer
 *       > fill out the scatter-gather list
 *     + put the physical address (the indirect reference to the
 *       scatterlist) in the descriptor pointer entity
 *
 *   - "Free" functions will:
 *     + if a scatter-gather list was constructed (DPD_AUXMAP pointer
 *       is non-NULL):
 *       > unlock memory pages
 *       > free the scatter-gather list
 *
 * So, all these functions have a symmetrical argument set:
 * - uint32_t    entity - descriptor pointer entity ID
 * - void       *desc   - descriptor
 * - void       *auxmap - auxiliary data to maintain with the descriptor
 *                       that tracks the resources used for this pointer.
