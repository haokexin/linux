	---help---
	  If you have a network (Ethernet) card belonging to this class, say Y
	  and read the Ethernet-HOWTO, available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

	  Note that the answer to this question doesn't directly affect the
	  kernel: saying N will just cause the configurator to skip all
	  the questions about Freescale devices. If you say Y, you will be
	  asked for your specific card in the following questions.

	  Say Y here if you want to use the built-in 10/100 Fast ethernet
	  controller on some Motorola ColdFire and Freescale i.MX processors.

	  This option enables support for the MPC5200's on-chip
	  Fast Ethernet Controller

	default y
	---help---
	  The MPC5200's FEC can connect to the Ethernet either with
	  an external MII PHY chip or 10 Mbps 7-wire interface
	  (Motorola? industry standard).
	  If your board uses an external PHY connected to FEC, enable this.
	  If not sure, enable.
	  If compiled as module, it will be called fec_mpc52xx_phy.

config DPA_OFFLINE_PORTS

	depends on DPA
	default y
	help
	  The Offline Parsing / Host Command ports (short: OH ports, of Offline ports) provide
	  most of the functionality of the regular, online ports, except they receive their
	  frames from a core or an accelerator on the SoC, via QMan frame queues,
	  rather than directly from the network.
	  Offline ports are configured via PCD (Parse-Classify-Distribute) schemes, just like
	  any online FMan port. They deliver the processed frames to frame queues, according
	  to the applied PCD configurations.

	  Choosing this feature will not impact the functionality and/or performance of the system,
	  so it is safe to have it.

config DPAA_ETH_SG_SUPPORT
	bool "Add support for S/G frames in the DPAA Ethernet driver"
	depends on DPA
	default n

	  Configure this to add S/G frames support in the DPAA Ethernet driver.

		  Statically-defined FQIDs are round-robin assigned to all WQs (0..7). PCD queues are always
