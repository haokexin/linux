	  More information is contained in the directory <file:Documentation/tdm/>,
	  especially in the file called "summary" there.
	  If you want TDM support, you should say Y here and also to the
	  specific driver for your bus adapter(s) below.

	  This TDM support can also be built as a module.  If so, the module
	  will be called tdm-core.

config TDM_CHARDEV
	tristate "TDM device interface"
	default n
	help
	  Say Y here to use tdm-dev device files, usually found in the /dev
	  directory on your system.  They make it possible to have user-space
	  programs use the TDM device. Information on how to do this is
	  contained in the file <file:Documentation/tdm/dev-interface>.

	  This support is also available as a module.  If so, the module
	  will be called tdm-dev.

config TDM_DEBUG_CORE
	bool "TDM Core debugging messages"
	help
	  Say Y here if you want the TDM core to produce a bunch of debug
	  messages to the system log.  Select this if you are having a
	  problem with TDM support and want to see more of what is going on.
