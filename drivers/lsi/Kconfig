config LSI_NAND
	bool "NAND Driver for LSI's APP and ACP"
	depends on ACP
	select MTD_NAND
	help
		Add NAND support to LSI's APP/ACP boards.

config LSI_UBOOTENV
	bool "U-Boot Environment Access for LSI's APP and ACP"
	depends on ( ACP && LSI_NAND && CRC32 )
	help
		Add U-Boot environment access on LSI's APP/ACP boards.

config SERIAL_ACP
	bool "LSI's Serial Driver for the ACP"
	select SERIAL_CORE
	help
	  Handles the serial ports (there are two) on LSI's ACP board
	  and the simulated serial port provided by ISS.

config SERIAL_ACP_CONSOLE
	bool "Console on the ACP serial port"
	depends on SERIAL_ACP=y
	select SERIAL_CORE_CONSOLE
	help
	  If you say Y here, it will be possible to use a serial port as the
	  system console (the system console is the device which receives all
	  kernel messages and warnings and which allows logins in single user
	  mode). This could be useful if some terminal or printer is connected
	  to that serial port.

	  Even if you say Y here, the currently visible virtual console
	  (/dev/tty0) will still be used as the system console by default, but
	  you can alter that using a kernel command line option such as
	  "console=ttyS1". (Try "man bootparam" or see the documentation of
	  your boot loader (grub or lilo or loadlin) about how to pass options
	  to the kernel at boot time.)

	  If you don't have a VGA card installed and you say Y here, the
	  kernel will automatically use the first serial line, /dev/ttyS0, as
	  system console.

	  You can set that using a kernel command line option such as
	  "console=uart8250,io,0x3f8,9600n8"
	  "console=uart8250,mmio,0xff5e0000,115200n8".
	  and it will switch to normal serial console when the corresponding
	  port is ready.
	  "earlycon=uart8250,io,0x3f8,9600n8"
	  "earlycon=uart8250,mmio,0xff5e0000,115200n8".
	  it will not only setup early console.

	  If unsure, say N.

config SERIAL_ACP_CONSOLE_POLL
	bool "Don't use interrupts in the ACP serial driver"
	depends on SERIAL_ACP_CONSOLE
	select CONSOLE_POLL
	help
		When selected, the ACP serial driver won't use interrupts.
		This is only intended to be used for debugging.

		If unsure, say N.

config LSI_NET
	bool "Network interface for LSI's APP and ACP"
	help
	  Network interface driver for LSI's APP and ACP series boards.

config LSI_NET_NUM_RX_DESC
	int "NIC driver: Number of receive descriptors"
	depends on LSI_NET
	default "4"
	help
          The number of receive descriptors to allocate.

config LSI_NET_RX_BUF_SZ
    int "NIC driver: Size of the receive buffer"
    depends on LSI_NET
    default "32768"
    help
        The size of the receive buffer.

config LSI_NET_NUM_TX_DESC
    int "NIC driver: Number of transmit descriptors"
    depends on LSI_NET
    default "4"
    help
        The number of transmit descriptors to allocate.

config LSI_NET_TX_BUF_SZ
    int "NIC driver: Size of the transmit buffer"
    depends on LSI_NET
    default "32768"
    help
        The size of the transmit buffer.
