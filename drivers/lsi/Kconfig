		Add NAND support to LSI's APP/ACP boards.

config SERIAL_ACP
	bool "LSI's Serial Driver for the ACP"
	select SERIAL_CORE
	help
	  Handles the serial ports (there are two) on LSI's ACP board
	  and the simulated serial port provided by ISS.

config SERIAL_ACP_CONSOLE
	bool "Console on the ACP serial port"
	depends on SERIAL_ACP=y
	select SERIAL_CORE_CONSOLE
	help
	  If you say Y here, it will be possible to use a serial port as the
	  system console (the system console is the device which receives all
	  kernel messages and warnings and which allows logins in single user
	  mode). This could be useful if some terminal or printer is connected
	  to that serial port.

	  Even if you say Y here, the currently visible virtual console
	  (/dev/tty0) will still be used as the system console by default, but
	  you can alter that using a kernel command line option such as
	  "console=ttyS1". (Try "man bootparam" or see the documentation of
	  your boot loader (grub or lilo or loadlin) about how to pass options
	  to the kernel at boot time.)

	  If you don't have a VGA card installed and you say Y here, the
	  kernel will automatically use the first serial line, /dev/ttyS0, as
	  system console.

	  You can set that using a kernel command line option such as
	  "console=uart8250,io,0x3f8,9600n8"
	  "console=uart8250,mmio,0xff5e0000,115200n8".
	  and it will switch to normal serial console when the corresponding
	  port is ready.
	  "earlycon=uart8250,io,0x3f8,9600n8"
	  "earlycon=uart8250,mmio,0xff5e0000,115200n8".
	  it will not only setup early console.

	  If unsure, say N.

config SERIAL_ACP_CONSOLE_POLL
	bool "Don't use interrupts in the ACP serial driver"
	depends on SERIAL_ACP_CONSOLE
	select CONSOLE_POLL
	help
		When selected, the ACP serial driver won't use interrupts.
		This is only intended to be used for debugging.

		If unsure, say N.
