config CRAMFS
	tristate "Compressed ROM file system support (cramfs)"
	depends on BLOCK
	select ZLIB_INFLATE
	help
	  Saying Y here includes support for CramFs (Compressed ROM File
	  System).  CramFs is designed to be a simple, small, and compressed
	  file system for ROM based embedded systems.  CramFs is read-only,
	  limited to 256MB file systems (with 16MB files), and doesn't support
	  16/32 bits uid/gid, hard links and timestamps.

	  See <file:Documentation/filesystems/cramfs.txt> and
	  <file:fs/cramfs/README> for further information.

	  To compile this as a module, choose M here: the module will be called
	  cramfs.  Note that the root file system (the one containing the
	  directory /) cannot be compiled as a module.

	  If unsure, say N.

config CRAMFS_LINEAR
	bool "Use linear addressing for CramFs"
	depends on CRAMFS
	help
	  This option tells the CramFs driver to load data directly from
	  a linear adressed memory range (usually non volatile memory
	  like flash) instead of going through the block device layer.
	  This saves some memory since no intermediate buffering is
	  necessary.

	  This is also a prerequisite for XIP of binaries stored on the
	  filesystem.

	  The location of the CramFs image in memory is board
	  dependent. Therefore, if you say Y, you must know the proper
	  physical address where to store the CramFs image and specify
	  it using the physaddr=0x******** mount option (for example:
	  "mount -t cramfs -o physaddr=0x100000 none /mnt").

	  If unsure, say N.

config CRAMFS_LINEAR_XIP
	bool "Support XIP on linear CramFs"
	depends on CRAMFS_LINEAR
	help
	  You must say Y to this option if you want to be able to run
	  applications directly from non-volatile memory.  XIP
	  applications are marked by setting the sticky bit (ie, "chmod
	  +t <app name>").  A cramfs file system then needs to be
	  created using mkcramfs (with XIP cramfs support in
	  it). Applications marked for XIP execution will not be
	  compressed since they have to run directly from flash.

config ROOT_CRAMFS_LINEAR
	bool "Root file system on linear CramFs"
	depends on CRAMFS_LINEAR
	help
	  Say Y if you have enabled linear CramFs, and you want to be
	  able to use the linear CramFs image as a root file system.  To
	  actually have the kernel mount this CramFs image as a root
	  file system, you must also pass the command line parameter
	  "root=/dev/null rootflags=physaddr=0x********" to the kernel
	  (replace 0x******** with the physical address location of the
	  linear CramFs image to boot with).
