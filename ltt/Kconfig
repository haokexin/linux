	select MARKERS
	select TRACEPOINTS
	default n
	help
	  It is possible for the kernel to log important events to a trace
	  facility. Doing so enables the use of the generated traces in order
	  to reconstruct the dynamic behavior of the kernel, and hence the
	  whole system.

	  The tracing process contains 4 parts :
	      1) The logging of events by key parts of the kernel.
	      2) The tracer that keeps the events in a data buffer (uses
	         relay).
	      3) A trace daemon that interacts with the tracer and is
	         notified every time there is a certain quantity of data to
	         read from the tracer.
	      4) A trace event data decoder that reads the accumulated data
	         and formats it in a human-readable format.

	  If you say Y, the first component will be built into the kernel.

	help
	  Add checks for random access to LTTng relay buffers. Given those
	  buffers are a linked list, such access are rather slow. Rare accesses
	  are OK; they can be caused by large writes (more than a page large) or
	  by reentrancy (e.g. interrupt nesting over the tracing code).

config LTT_TRACE_CONTROL

	  If you enable this option, the debugfs-based Linux Trace Toolkit Trace

	default y
	help
	  If you enable this option, the Linux Trace Toolkit Tracer will be
	  either built in the kernel or as module.

	  Critical parts of the kernel will call upon the kernel tracing
	  function. The data is then recorded by the tracer if a trace daemon
	  is running in user-space and has issued a "start" command.

	help
	  This option enables dynamic alignment of data in buffers. The
	  alignment is made on the smallest size between architecture size
	  and the size of the value to be written.

	  Dynamically calculating the offset of the data has a performance cost,
	  but it is more efficient on some architectures (especially 64 bits) to
	  align data than to write it unaligned.

	  If you enable this option, the Linux Trace Toolkit Tracer will

	  Special crash extension should be used to extract ltt buffers.

	  This module saves the state of the running kernel at trace start
	  into the trace buffers along with the ongoing tracing information.
