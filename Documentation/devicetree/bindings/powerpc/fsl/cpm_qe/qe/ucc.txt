* UCC (Unified Communications Controllers)

Required properties:
- device_type : should be "network", "hldc", "uart", "transparent"
  "bisync", "atm", "tdm" or "serial".
- compatible : Describes the specific device attached to the UCC.
  Examples include "ucc_geth", "fsl_atm", "ucc_uart" and "fsl,ucc-tdm".
- cell-index : the ucc number(1-8), corresponding to UCCx in UM.
- reg : Offset and length of the register set for the device
- interrupts : <a b> where a is the interrupt number and b is a
  field that represents an encoding of the sense and level
  information for the interrupt.  This should be encoded based on
  the information in section 2) depending on the type of interrupt
  controller you have.
- interrupt-parent : the phandle for the interrupt controller that
  services interrupts for this device.
- pio-handle : The phandle for the Parallel I/O port configuration.
- port-number : for UART drivers, the port number to use, between 0 and 3.
  This usually corresponds to the /dev/ttyQE device, e.g. <0> = /dev/ttyQE0.
  The port number is added to the minor number of the device.  Unlike the
  CPM UART driver, the port-number is required for the QE UART driver.
- soft-uart : for UART drivers, if specified this means the QE UART device
  driver should use "Soft-UART" mode, which is needed on some SOCs that have
  broken UART hardware.  Soft-UART is provided via a microcode upload.
- rx-clock-name: the UCC receive clock source
  "none": clock source is disabled
  "brg1" through "brg16": clock source is BRG1-BRG16, respectively
  "clk1" through "clk24": clock source is CLK1-CLK24, respectively
- tx-clock-name: the UCC transmit clock source
  "none": clock source is disabled
  "brg1" through "brg16": clock source is BRG1-BRG16, respectively
  "clk1" through "clk24": clock source is CLK1-CLK24, respectively
The following two properties are deprecated.  rx-clock has been replaced
with rx-clock-name, and tx-clock has been replaced with tx-clock-name.
Drivers that currently use the deprecated properties should continue to
do so, in order to support older device trees, but they should be updated
to check for the new properties first.
- rx-clock : represents the UCC receive clock source.
  0x00 : clock source is disabled;
  0x1~0x10 : clock source is BRG1~BRG16 respectively;
  0x11~0x28: clock source is QE_CLK1~QE_CLK24 respectively.
- tx-clock: represents the UCC transmit clock source;
  0x00 : clock source is disabled;
  0x1~0x10 : clock source is BRG1~BRG16 respectively;
  0x11~0x28: clock source is QE_CLK1~QE_CLK24 respectively.

Required properties for network device_type:
- mac-address : list of bytes representing the ethernet address.
- phy-handle : The phandle for the PHY connected to this controller.

Recommended properties:
- phy-connection-type : a string naming the controller/PHY interface type,
  i.e., "mii" (default), "rmii", "gmii", "rgmii", "rgmii-id" (Internal
  Delay), "rgmii-txid" (delay on TX only), "rgmii-rxid" (delay on RX only),
  "tbi", or "rtbi".

Required properties for fsl, ucc-tdm, compatible:
- fsl,rx-sync-clock, fsl,tx-sync-clock: the TDM sync clock source for
  receive/transmit
  "none": clock source is disabled
  "rsync_pin" : clock source is TDM_A1 RSYNC pin
  "brg9" through "brg15" : clock source is BRG9-BRG15, respectively
- fsl,tdm-tx-timeslot, fsl,tdm-rx-timeslot: time slot mask for transmit/receive
  Each bit (LSB first) corresponds to a time slot. The time slot is enabled
  if the bit is set
- fsl,tdm-id : It is the tdm port number. e.g. P1021E has 4 ports -  port
	A/B/C/D mapping to number 0/1/2/3.
- fsl,tdm-framer-type : It should be "t1" or "e1", "t1" for T1 line rate, and
	"e1" for E1 line rate
- fsl,tdm-mode : It is tsa working mode. It should be "normal" or
	"internal-loopback"
- fsl,siram-entry-id : This number is used for setting index siram entry
	It should be 0/2/4.../14. Each TDM should not use the same number
	with others
