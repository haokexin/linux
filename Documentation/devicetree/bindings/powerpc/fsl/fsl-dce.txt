Overview

DESCRIPTION

    The Decompression and Compression Engine is an accelerator compatible
    with Datapath Architecture providing lossless data decompression and
    compression for the QorIQ family of SoCs.

DCE Node

Description

    Node defines the base address of the DCE block.
    This block specifies the address range of all global
    configuration registers for the DCE block.  It
    also receives error interrupts


PROPERTIES

   - compatible
      Usage: required
      Value type: <string>
      Definition: Must include "fsl,dce"

   - reg
      Usage: required
      Value type: <prop-encoded-array>
      Definition: A standard property.  Specifies the physical
          address and length of the DCE configuration registers.
          registers

   - interrupts
      Usage: required
      Value type: <prop_encoded-array>
      Definition:  Specifies the interrupts generated by this
           device.  The value of the interrupts property
           consists of one interrupt specifier. The format
           of the specifier is defined by the binding document
           describing the node's interrupt parent.
           This device only generates an error interrupt.

   Note: All other standard properties (see the ePAPR) are allowed
   but are optional.


EXAMPLE
	dce@312000 {
		compatible = "fsl,dce";
		reg = <0x312000 0x10000>;
		interrupts = <16 2 1 4>;
	};
