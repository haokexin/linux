fsl,mpc5200-mscan nodes
-----------------------
In addition to the required compatible-, reg- and interrupt-properties, you can
also specify which clock source shall be used for the controller:

- fsl,mscan-clock-source : a string describing the clock source. Valid values
			   are:	"ip" for ip bus clock
				 "ref" for reference clock (XTAL)
			   "ref" is default in case this property is not
			   present.

fsl,mpc5121-mscan nodes
-----------------------
In addition to the required compatible-, reg- and interrupt-properties, you can
also specify which clock source and divider shall be used for the controller:

- fsl,mscan-clock-source : a string describing the clock source. Valid values
			   are:	"ip" for ip bus clock
				"ref" for reference clock
				"sys" for system clock
			   If this property is not present, an optimal CAN
			   clock source and frequency based on the system
			   clock will be selected. If this is not possible,
			   the reference clock will be used.

- fsl,mscan-clock-divider: for the reference and system clock, an additional
			   clock divider can be specified. By default, a
			   value of 1 is used.

Note that the MPC5121 Rev. 1 processor is not supported.

fsl,flexcan-v1.0 nodes
-----------------------
In addition to the required compatible-, reg- and interrupt-properties, you can
also specify which clock source shall be used for the controller.

- fsl,flexcan-clock-source : CAN Engine Clock Source.This property selects
			     the peripheral clock. PLLclock is fed to the
			     prescaler to generate the Serial Clock (Sclock).
			     Valid values are 0,1
			     "0": CAN engine clock source is oscillator clock.
				Current release doesnâ€™t support this option.
			     "1" The CAN engine clock source is the bus clock
				(platform clock).

- fsl,flexcan-clock-divider : for the reference and system clock, an additional
			      clock divider can be specified.

Examples:
	can@1300 {
		compatible = "fsl,mpc5121-mscan";
		interrupts = <12 0x8>;
		interrupt-parent = <&ipic>;
		reg = <0x1300 0x80>;
	};

	can@1380 {
		compatible = "fsl,mpc5121-mscan";
		interrupts = <13 0x8>;
		interrupt-parent = <&ipic>;
		reg = <0x1380 0x80>;
		fsl,mscan-clock-source = "ref";
		fsl,mscan-clock-divider = <3>;
	};

	can0@1c000 {
		compatible = "fsl,flexcan-v1.0";
		reg = <0x1c000 0x1000>;
		interrupts = <48 0x2>;
		interrupt-parent = <&mpic>;
		fsl,flexcan-clock-source = <1>;
		fsl,flexcan-clock-divider = <2>;
	};
