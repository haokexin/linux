Block I/O Cgroup

1. Overview

Using this feature the owners of any type of I/O can be determined.
This allows dm-ioband to control block I/O bandwidth even when it is
accepting delayed write requests. dm-ioband can find the cgroup of
each request. It is also for possible that others working on I/O
bandwidth throttling to use this functionality to control asynchronous
I/O with a little enhancement.

2. Setting up blkio-cgroup

The following kernel config options are required.

CONFIG_CGROUPS=y
CONFIG_CGROUP_BLKIO=y

Selecting the options for the cgroup memory subsystem is also recommended
as it makes it possible to give some I/O bandwidth and memory to a selected
cgroup to control delayed write requests. The amount of dirty pages is
limited within the cgroup even if the allocated bandwidth is narrow.

CONFIG_RESOURCE_COUNTERS=y
CONFIG_CGROUP_MEM_RES_CTLR=y

3. User interface

3.1 Mounting the cgroup filesystem

First, mount the cgroup filesystem in order to enable observation and
modification of the blkio-cgroup settings.

# mount -t cgroup -o blkio none /cgroup

3.2 The blkio.id file

After mounting the cgroup filesystem the blkio.id file will be visible
in the cgroup directory. This file contains a unique ID number for
each cgroup. When an I/O operation starts, blkio-cgroup sets the
page's ID number on the page cgroup. The cgroup of I/O can be
determined by retrieving the ID number from the page cgroup, because
the page cgroup is associated with the page which is involved in the
I/O.
