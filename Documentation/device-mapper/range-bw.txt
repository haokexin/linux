Range-BW I/O controller by Dong-Jae Kang <djkang@etri.re.kr>


1. Introduction
===============

The design of Range-BW is related with three another parts, Cgroup,
bio-cgroup (or blkio-cgroup) and dm-ioband and it was implemented as
an additional controller for dm-ioband.
Cgroup framework is used to support process grouping mechanism and
bio-cgroup is used to control delayed I/O or non-direct I/O. Finally,
dm-ioband is a kind of I/O controller allowing the proportional I/O
bandwidth to process groups based on its priority.
The supposed controller supports the process group-based range
bandwidth according to the priority or importance of the group. Range
bandwidth means the predicable I/O bandwidth with minimum and maximum
value defined by administrator.

Minimum I/O bandwidth should be guaranteed for stable performance or
reliability of specific service and I/O bandwidth over maximum should
be throttled to protect the limited I/O resource from
over-provisioning in unnecessary usage or to reserve the I/O bandwidth
for another use.
So, Range-BW was implemented to include the two concepts, guaranteeing
of minimum I/O requirement and limitation of unnecessary bandwidth
depending on its priority.
And it was implemented as device mapper driver such like dm-ioband.
So, it is independent of the underlying specific I/O scheduler, for
example, CFQ, AS, NOOP, deadline and so on.

* Attention
Range-BW supports the predicable I/O bandwidth, but it should be
configured in the scope of total I/O bandwidth of the I/O system to
guarantee the minimum I/O requirement. For example, if total I/O
bandwidth is 40Mbytes/sec,

the summary of I/O bandwidth configured in each process group should
be equal or smaller than 40Mbytes/sec.
So, we need to check total I/O bandwidth before set it up.

2. Setup and Installation
=========================

This part is same with dm-ioband,
../../Documentation/device-mapper/ioband.txt or
http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/ioband/wiki/dm-ioband/man/setup
except the allocation of range-bw values.

3. Usage
========

It is very useful to refer the documentation for dm-ioband in
../../Documentation/device-mapper/ioband.txt or

http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/ioband/wiki/dm-ioband, because
Range-BW follows the basic semantics of dm-ioband.
This example is for range-bw configuration.

# mount the cgroup
mount -t cgroup -o blkio none /root/cgroup/blkio

# create the process groups (3 groups)
mkdir /root/cgroup/blkio/bgroup1
mkdir /root/cgroup/blkio/bgroup2
mkdir /root/cgroup/blkio/bgroup3

# create the ioband device ( name : ioband1 )
echo "0 $(blockdev --getsize /dev/sdb2) ioband /dev/sdb2 1 0 0 none
range-bw 0 :0:0" | dmsetup create ioband1
: Attention - device name (/dev/sdb2) should be modified depending on
your system

# init ioband device ( type and policy )
dmsetup message ioband1 0 type cgroup
dmsetup message ioband1 0 policy range-bw

# attach the groups to the ioband device
dmsetup message ioband1 0 attach 2
dmsetup message ioband1 0 attach 3
dmsetup message ioband1 0 attach 4
: group number can be referred in /root/cgroup/blkio/bgroup1/blkio.id

# allocate the values ( range-bw ) : XXX Kbytes
: the sum of minimum I/O bandwidth in each group should be equal or
smaller than total bandwidth to be supported by your system

# range : about 100~500 Kbytes
dmsetup message ioband1 0 range-bw 2:100:500

# range : about 700~1000 Kbytes
dmsetup message ioband1 0 range-bw 3:700:1000

# range : about 30~35Mbytes
dmsetup message ioband1 0 range-bw 4:30000:35000

You can confirm the configuration of range-bw by using this command :
[root@localhost range-bw]# dmsetup table --target ioband
ioband1: 0 305235000 ioband 8:18 1 4 128 cgroup \
    range-bw 16384 :0:0 2:100:500 3:700:1000 4:30000:35000
