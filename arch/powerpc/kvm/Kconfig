menuconfig VIRTUALIZATION
	bool "Virtualization"
	---help---
	  Say Y here to get to see options for using your Linux host to run
	  other operating systems inside virtual machines (guests).
	  This option alone does not add any kernel code.

	  If you say N, all options in this submenu will be skipped and
	  disabled.

config PARAVIRT
        bool "Enable paravirtualization code"
        default y
        help
          This changes the kernel so it can modify itself when it is run
          under a hypervisor, potentially improving performance significantly
          over full virtualization.  However, when run without a hypervisor
          the kernel is theoretically slower and slightly larger.

          CONFIG_PARAVIRT assume a E500 like core.

config PARAVIRT_PTE
        bool "Enable 64 Bit PTE to support VMMU"
        default n
        help
          CONFIG_PARAVIRT will use 64 bit PTE for VMMU.

config PARAVIRT_CLOCK
        bool
        default n

config PARAVIRT_DEBUG
       bool "paravirt-ops debugging"
       depends on PARAVIRT && DEBUG_KERNEL
       help
         Enable to debug paravirt_ops internals.  Specifically, BUG if
         a paravirt_op is missing when it is called.

	tristate "KVM support for PowerPC book3s_64 processors"
	depends on EXPERIMENTAL && PPC64
	select KVM
	select KVM_BOOK3S_64_HANDLER
	---help---
	  Support running unmodified book3s_64 and book3s_32 guest kernels
	  in virtual machines on book3s_64 host processors.

	  This module provides access to the hardware capabilities through
	  a character device node named /dev/kvm.

	  If unsure, say N.

config KVM_440
	bool "KVM support for PowerPC 440 processors"
	depends on EXPERIMENTAL && 44x
	select KVM
	---help---
	  Support running unmodified 440 guest kernels in virtual machines on
	  440 host processors.

	  This module provides access to the hardware capabilities through
	  a character device node named /dev/kvm.

	  If unsure, say N.

config KVM_EXIT_TIMING
	bool "Detailed exit timing"
	depends on KVM_440 || KVM_E500
	---help---
	  Calculate elapsed time for every exit/enter cycle. A per-vcpu
	  report is available in debugfs kvm/vm#_vcpu#_timing.
	  The overhead is relatively small, however it is not recommended for
	  production environments.

	  If unsure, say N.

config KVM_E500
	bool "KVM support for PowerPC E500 processors"
	depends on EXPERIMENTAL && E500
	select KVM
	---help---
	  Support running unmodified E500 guest kernels in virtual machines on
	  E500 host processors.

	  This module provides access to the hardware capabilities through
	  a character device node named /dev/kvm.

	  If unsure, say N.
